# DIP-Project-Semantic-Aware-Colour-Transfer
* Implementation of the paper : Sky is Not the Limit: Semantic-Aware Sky Replacement
* Github Link: https://github.com/SaumyaRawat/DIP-Project-Semantic-Aware-Colour-Transfer.git
* Report to the project can be found in the repo. 

## Pipeline 
* Label Images with FCN model
* Retrieve images with diverse sky appearances and similar semantic content for replacement
* Replace the sky from the selected image to the target
* Transfer colour between target and source-sky images to match with the new sky

##NOTE : Code 
* Code requires caffe-cpu
* Mat files present in mat_files (on git-lfs) are required to run the code
* main.m consists of the pipeline execution, name of input image from the dataset provided in the dataset folder is added to file1. 
* The large files are present in the google drive : https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3Z3CBsZVuvVMU5NYkMwS200RDQ
